# ESW Waste Segmentation

## Description

This Android application performs on-device waste segmentation using a TensorFlow Lite model trained to detect classes such as **Animal**, **Waste**, and **Person**. Images are captured from the camera or selected from the gallery, segmented on the device, and the results (masks and statistics) are saved locally and optionally uploaded to Firebase for further analysis.

---

## Getting Started

To use this repository for segmentation on your own device or model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. Open the `ESW` folder as a project in **Android Studio**.
3. Ensure you have Android SDK **34** installed and a device with **Android 9 (API 28)+** and **ARM64** (arm64-v8a) CPU.
4. Verify the segmentation model:
   - Default model file: `app/src/main/assets/yolo11_seg.tflite`.
   - If you use another model, replace this file and keep the same name, or update the path in `SegmentationHelper.kt`.
5. Configure **Firebase** (optional but recommended):
   - Create a Firebase project and an Android app with package name `com.example.esw`.
   - Download `google-services.json` and place it in the `ESW/app/` directory.
   - Make sure the Realtime Database URL in `MainActivity.kt` matches your Firebase project.
6. Let Gradle sync and resolve all dependencies.
7. Connect an Android device (USB debugging enabled) or start an ARM64 emulator.
8. Select the `app` configuration in Android Studio and click **Run**.

## How the Model Is Integrated

- The TensorFlow Lite model file `yolo11_seg.tflite` is loaded from the **assets** folder using a memory-mapped `ByteBuffer`.
- Before inference, each image is converted to `ARGB_8888`, resized to **640×640** with letterboxing, and normalized to `[0, 1]`.
- The model outputs bounding boxes, class scores, and segmentation masks.
- Post-processing builds per-class masks, overlays them on the original image, and computes:
  - Per-class pixel counts and coverage percentage.
  - Overall image coverage and timing statistics (preprocess, inference, postprocess).
- All of this logic is implemented in `SegmentationHelper.kt` and used by `MainActivity.kt` when you capture or select an image.

## Where Is Collected Data Stored?

1. **On the device (local files)**
   - Folder: `Android/data/com.example.esw/files/segmentation_captures/`.
   - Files:
     - `captures.csv` – one line per capture with timestamps, coverage, delegate used, and local image path.
     - `seg_<timestamp>.jpg` – segmented output images.

2. **In Firebase (if configured)**
   - **Realtime Database** node: `segmentation_results`.
   - Each entry contains timestamp, coverage, processing times, class breakdown, and (if available) the image URL.
   - **Firebase Storage** folder: `segmented/seg_<timestamp>.jpg` for uploaded images.

---

## How to Download This Collected Data

- **Local files from device**
  - In Android Studio, open **Device File Explorer** and navigate to
    `Android/data/com.example.esw/files/segmentation_captures/`.
  - Right-click the folder or files and choose **Save As** to download them.
  - Alternatively, use `adb pull` on that folder.

- **From Firebase**
  - Use the Firebase Console to export data from the `segmentation_results` node as JSON.
  - Download images directly from the Firebase Storage browser or via the Storage SDK / CLI.

## How to Use Debug Logging

- Open **Logcat** in Android Studio while the app is running.
- Filter by tags:
  - `MainActivity` – camera, capture flow, Firebase logging.
  - `SegmentationHelper` – model loading, delegate selection, timing, and post-processing.
- You can add your own logs using `Log.d`, `Log.i`, or `Log.e` in the Kotlin files.

---

## How to Change Auto-Capture Interval

- In the app, tap **Start Auto Capture** and enter the desired interval in **seconds**.
- To change the default value in code, adjust the logic in `MainActivity.kt` inside `showAutoCaptureDialog()` and the `autoCaptureIntervalMs` variable.

---

## Minimal Requirements

- Android Studio with Gradle plugin 8.x.
- Android device with Android 9+ and ARM64 (arm64-v8a).
- Internet access if you want to use Firebase upload.
- For the optional desktop serial GUI (`ESW/GUI.py`): Python 3.8+, `pyserial`, and `matplotlib`.
